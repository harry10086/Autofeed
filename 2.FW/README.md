在 Arduino IoT Cloud  的 Sketch 输入到 Arduino 主文件内，需要根据实际的命名修改变量的定义。
仔细看生成的默认文件说明进行核对，如：
```c++
/* 
  Sketch generated by the Arduino IoT Cloud Thing "Untitled"
  https://create.arduino.cc/cloud/things/e76c61ac-3b10-4a5c-8fa4-4f11229c3a53 

  Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description

  The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing

  下面这个变量名称和 Thing 创建名称相关

  int speed;
  bool pushbutton;

  Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
  which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
  These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.
